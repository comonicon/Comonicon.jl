# A Beginner Guide for CLIs

The command-line interface (CLI) is the oldest form of user interface
in the history of computers since monitors were invented. 

It reads a command from the terminal, execute the command
and print out the results or logs. This is similar to Read-Eval-Repeat-Loop (REPL)
of the Julia language, but is supported by the system and
is general to any language.
